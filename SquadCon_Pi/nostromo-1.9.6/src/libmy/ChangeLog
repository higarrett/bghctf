1.6
===
- strcuts(): don't exceed the source string buffer boundary by one byte if
  the start character isn't found.  Bug reported by Szabolcs Nagy

- cast char to int for tolower(3).  caused compilation error on some
  platforms

- fixed -pedantic compile option source code quirks
- replaced old BSD copyright headers with new one

1.3
===
- replaced all vsprintf(3) with vfprintf(3)
- removed nsend() because too insecure

1.2
===
- fparse(): instead of read(2) byte by byte from the file, one read(2) from
  the whole file to memory is done. memset(3) have been discarded totaly.
  this turns fparse() 20 times faster as in the version before!
