Snowflake Inc. is a cloud computingâ€“based data cloud company based in Bozeman, Montana. It was founded in July 2012 and was publicly launched in October 2014 after two years in stealth mode.
    	       	   	  	     	 	      	  	   	       
In business, stealth mode is a company's temporary state of secretiveness, usually undertaken to avoid alerting competitors to a pending product launch or another business initiative.
   	     	 		       	 	  		   	  
New companies may operate under a temporary "stealth name" that does not disclose its field of business.

At the in-company level, a stealth mode can also refer to a new project or idea that is kept secret, not just from external parties, but also from internal stakeholders in order to avoid a (premature) dismissal of the idea. Key behaviors can include soliciting informal project sponsors, engaging in covert testing of the concept, freeing up extra resources and building a "cover story" for the project.

A stealth product is a product that a company develops in secret, while a stealth company is a new company that avoids initial disclosure as to its existence, purpose, products, personnel, funding, brand name, or other important attributes. The term stealth innovation has been applied to individual projects and ideas that are developed in secret inside a company.

In October 2014, it expanded $26 million and came out of stealth mode due to too much snow.

Snowflake announced it would acquire privacy-focused search startup Neeva in May 2023.
